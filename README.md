Calculation of D-distance between two networks based on paper:
Schieber, T., Carpi, L., Díaz-Guilera, A. et al. [**Quantification of network structural dissimilarities**](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms13928) Nat Commun 8, 13928 (2017). 

Proposed measure is also used for network comparisons in the paper [**Growth signals determine the topology of evolving networks**](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/abd30b) Ana Vranić and Marija Mitrović Dankulov J. Stat. Mech. (2021)
